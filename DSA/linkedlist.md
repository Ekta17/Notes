# Linked List

Unlike arrays, it does not provide constant time access via index position. To access an element at Kth location, time required is O(K) as we will need to iterate from head to Kth node. 

Constant time to add a new node

Constant time to delete a node

**Singly LL** where each node has the details of next node 

**Doubly LL** where each node has the details of next as well as previous node

**Runner technique** In this technique we iterate the linked list using two pointers. One pointer iterates at a faster rate and is ahead of the second pointer. For example, to detect cycle in a linked list, you can use this technique.
