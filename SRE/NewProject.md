## SRE as a framework for new projects

- It is highly recommended to document the problems that you see first before diving in. 

- So, when joining a new project, or evaluating a new service, follow the following steps: 
    - figure out the team structure.
        - who owns what 
        - who is in charge
    - find any documentation the team has for their service or the project
    - get someone to draw the system architecture. 
        - Have them show you what connects to which service
        - what depends on the project 
        - how data flows through the service
        - how the project is deployed
